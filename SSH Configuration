Automate the User creation and authentication process on your environment by developing a playbook called prepare-environment.yml which includes the following steps:

Create a group called DevOps
Create a number of users Eissa, Ahmed, and Mirna who are going to be members of the DevOps team while keeping their primary group as it is
Create SSH key for the group of users of 2048 bits and key to be stored under .ssh/x_id_rsa where x is the name of the user
Use the authorized_key module to setup key-based authentication for the list of users
Fix sudo to run all commands without a password for the created list of users
Verify your configuration by changing remote_user to any of the newly created users.
Run your first playbook for the first time to implement the above requirements. Make sure to use the –ask-pass with root for the first time.
Verify that remote_user is working by switching the user to the remote_user in ansible.cfg and run the ping command for one last time with the –ask-pass option, followed by running the same command without the –ask-pass option.
